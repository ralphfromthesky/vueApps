    <div>
      <span class="text-[1.5rem]">defineAsyncComponent</span><br><br> is a built-in utility in Vue 3 that allows you to
      dynamically load components only when they are needed, which is helpful
      for code-splitting and improving the initial load time of your
      application. It is used to define asynchronous components, meaning the
      component is loaded lazily, typically when the user navigates to the part
      of the application that requires it.
